# This file ensures when the repository is cloned,
# this /target directory exists and is owned by the user
# who clones the repository.
# This is because /target is a Docker volume mounted
# into the local development Docker image, so that
# when we change the source, a host process
# (e.g. mvn compile or an IDE) can compile and
# generate changed classfiles, put them into this directory,
# and the Docker image Maven process can detect and reload
# the server process.
# Docker creates an empty directory as root when a
# volume does not exist on the host. (https://docs.docker.com/storage/)
# So if this directory does not exist at the time of
# running the local development Docker image,
# a root-owned /target directory will be created by Docker.
# This is not ideal as the host process would need to
# be run by root in order to compile and generate classfiles.

# Ignore everything in this directory
*
# Except this file
!.gitignore
